## Extension Settings

**Monorepo Manager** tries to detect the type of package (library, application or tool) based on configurable regexes.

The workspace folder prefix containing the emoji is also configurable.

You can also configure custom types with a prefix in your JSON settings:

```json
{
  "monoWorkspace.folders.custom": [
    {"regex":"app1", "prefix": "ðŸ”¥"},
    {"regex":"app2", "prefix": "ðŸ“š"}
  ]
}
```

You can find all options under "Monorepo Workspace" in your configurtion.
